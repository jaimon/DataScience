The Python script calculates the critical path for a set of tasks using linear programming. It evaluates three scenarios: best-case, average, and worst-case durations for each task.

The script will provide output for each scenario:

Best-case scenario
Average scenario
Worst-case scenario
For each scenario, the script displays the start time for tasks starting at time zero and the end time for tasks with the maximum duration. Additionally, it lists all solution variable values.
